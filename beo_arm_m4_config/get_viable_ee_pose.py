usage: mvit_rand_valid_ee_pose(500) tries 500 ee poses;
        if a plan can be successfully generated for a pose, the pose is considered valid;
        all valid poses are stored in a list of PostStamped objects and pickled to <your path to beo_arm_m4_config>/ee_poses.p;

In my experience 1 in 10 poses is valid, so if you want 50 valid poses, try 500 iterations
